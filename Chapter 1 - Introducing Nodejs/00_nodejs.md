It's functional, object-oriented, prototype-based language. 
Everything is an object or inherits from it. Even numbers and functions inherit from an object. The good parts are as follows:
- Functions are first-class objects
- Functions and block-scoped variables
- Closures and anonymous functions
- Loose typing (can be seen as a bad aspect)

Node.js introduced JavaScript to a group of API modules, some of the most frequently used are:
- filesystem
- process
- net
- http
- buffers
- streams
