Express is a rock-solid layer that helps you create applications faster. 
As it states on its website, it's a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework.
Node.js has an HTTP module that you can use to create a simple HTTP server. The problem is that it's too raw and you'll have to do a ton of work so that you can make it usable and modular. Instead of you creating that layer, you can use Express.
